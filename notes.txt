    // public -access modifier
    // static - no object is required to run program
    // void - return nothing
    // main - method name, String[] args- its a arrgument for main method

    -> Variables

        -> Store the values ?

            -> To retrieve data 
            -> To perform some operations on data
            -> To Store data

        -> brand
        -> description
        -> ratings
        -> price 

        -> Data you want to store, you need to specify data type
            -> above approach is called as Static Typed/Strict Typed

        -> Data Type is classification of data

            -> Primitive Data types 

                -> Fundamental data types, which are prebuilt to store numbers, decimals,
                    characters, symobols, true and false

                        -> byte
                        -> short
                        -> int

                        -> char
                        -> boolean


            -> Non-Primitive Data types

                -> Either we can use already defined by java, Strings, Arrays, Collections, Interfaces etc

                -> As a user you can create your own data types as well
                    Student, Employee, Company etc  
    
    -> NOTE : The local variable someDataNew2 may not have been initialized

    -> We have Instance Variables, Local Variables & Satic Variables 

        -> For any kind of Variables we work with, we need to specify Datatype

    -> Based on the data type we select, default values are applicable

    ->Code what i have done :
-> package second_variables;
public class LMSVariables {
// Student-> ID,Name,Email,Password, Gender, Mobile Number
//define datatype
    public static void main(String[] args) {

    -> Type Conversion & Type Casting

        -> Convert One Datatype to Another Datatype

    -> Type Conversion 

        -> Automatic / Implicit - is done by java Compiler, when Conversion is considered SAFE

        -> NO LOSS OF DATA (SAFE)

        -> WIDENING / Implicit Conversion / Type Conversion
        ->int num1 = 10;
        double num2 =num1; //type Conversion

        System.out.println("Original Value:" +num1);
        System.out.println("Converted Value:" +num2);

    -> Type Casting 

        -> Manual / Explicit - is done by developer, when Conversion is considered UNSAFE

        -> LOSS OF DATA (UNSAFE)

        -> NARROWING / Explicit Conversion / Type Casting

        -> To Perform Casting we need to keep target datatype in parentheses (int) before value

        ->double num3 = 3.14;

                            //you need to do the manual conversion
        System.out.println("Original Value:" +num3);
        System.out.println("Original Value:" +num4);

    -> Incompatible Conversions

        -> Text To Number or Number To Text (Possible)
         
        int zip = 500081;
       // String str_zip = (String)zip;//Cannot cast from int to String
       String str_zip = String.valueOf(zip);// String.valueOf is the key to do the process.
       System.out.println("Original Value:" +zip);
       System.out.println("Original Value:" +str_zip);
       System.out.println(str_zip+5);//it works but it will not add value ans will be 5000815  5 is add as a string we are passing in str that's why it is add as a string

       String str_zip_new = "500081";
       //String str_zip_new = "five lakhs eighty one";//lang.NumberFormatException it can't concat
       int zip_new = Integer.parseInt(str_zip_new);//Integer.parseInt  is the key to do the process.

Project Based - LMS - 2
In this project, you simulate a simple system that stores and processes a student’s academic and attendance details. 
store student information like:
ID 
Name 
Age 
Scores for quiz, assignment, and exam
Attendance percentage
Calculate:
Total score
Average score

Determine:
If the student is passing based on average score (75 or above)
Update:
Attendance (simulate an additional attended session)
Evaluate:
If the student qualifies for an attendance award (requires high attendance(80 and above) and a passing grade)
Based On above display results appropriately

                even before checking the condition

            -> Branching Statements 

                -> break - exits the loop, when used with for, while, 
                    do-while or switch 

                -> continue - skip the current Iteration 

                -> return - returns a value

    -> Scanner Class -> Predefined class designed to take user input

        -> nextInt(): Reads an integer value.
        -> nextDouble(): Reads a double value.
        -> nextLine(): Reads an entire line of text.

    -> Inheritance is achieved by creating a Relationship between classes

        -> Relationship between classes is done using extends keyword

        -> Child will extends Parent

    -> With Inheritance

        -> Code Reusability
        -> No Code Duplication i.e No Repeatability
        -> Project Size is Less as Code is Less
        -> Code Reliability Increases
        -> Code Maintainability Improved

    -> Types Of Inheritance

        -> Single Level Inheritance

            -> A class inherits from another single class only

            -> A extends B 
                A -> B (Guest -> VideoAdmin)

        -> Multi Level Inheritance

            -> A class inherits from another class, which inturn inherits from
                another class

            -> A extends B and B extends C 
                A -> B -> C  (Guest -> VideoAdmin -> SuperAdmin)


        -> Hierarchal Level Inheritance

            -> Multiple Classes Inherit from Same Super Class

                       A

                B   C     D   E

                                Guest 

            -> VideoAdmin -> ContentReviewer -> Teacher

        -> Multiple Inheritance

            -> One Class inherits from two or more classes (NOT OK)

            -> One Class inherits from two or more Interfaces (OK)

            -> Multiple Inheritance is not supported with Classes

            -> Multiple Inheritance is supported with Interfaces

                -> Classes - A class is a Blueprint for an object
                -> Interfaces - An interface is a Blueprint for a class
                -> Interfaces have special methods we call them as abstract methods

                    -> Concrete Methods - Concrete methods have implementation

                    -> Abstract Methods - Abstract methods don't have implementation

                -> When Working with Interfaces, we use keyword implements 

        -> Hybrid Level Inheritance

            -> Combination of at leasttwo types of Inheritance
                    Single + Multiple or Multilevel

                        A
                    B       C
                        D

14th Aug
========  

    -> super keyword, is used to refer the parent class members

        -> methods, variables, constructors 
        -> differentiate between members of subclass and members with
        same name in super class



15th Aug
========

-> Access Modifiers

    -> These are keywords, which controls visibility of class members

    -> If we get an understanding of Access Modifiers, Encapsulation will be easy
        to understand.

    -> We Have Following Access Modifiers

        -> Public
        -> Private
        -> Protected
        -> Default

    -> NOTE : If you understand access modifiers will using variables, the same concept
        is extends to other members as well, with only slight difference for Classes
            (Mainly for top level classes)
            -> Top level classes only support public and default

            
    -> Encapsulation

    -> Encapsulation describes the ability of an object, to hide
    it's data(variables) from rest of the world.

    -> If you take a class, what it does ?

        Class binds variables, methods, constructors, blocks etc 


        16th Aug
        ========

    -> Encapsulation Demo

    -> Using Encapsulation means

        -> Declaring all the data i.e variables as Private
        -> Providing getters and setters methods to access and modify private variable

20th Aug
========

-> Abstraction - Hiding implementation and showing only the essential features of an object.

-> To work with Abstraction, we need to know about

    -> Interfaces
    -> Abstract Classes

-> A class is a Blueprint for an object

-> Interfaces 
    
    -> An interface is a Blueprint for a class

    -> Interfaces have special methods we call them as abstract methods
            -> Abstract Methods - Abstract methods don't have implementation
    
    -> Interfaces have only constants (Static Final Variables)

    -> An interface is like a Contract, which means you are bind by Contract

    -> Till Java 7, this is how Interfaces Worked, only abstract methods no implementations

        -> From Java 8, we got new updates in interfaces

            -> You you can something called as default methods
